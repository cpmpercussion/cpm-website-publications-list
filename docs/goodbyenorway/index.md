Let me know if there's anything you want---save it from the recycling centre!

## Furniture

### Corner sofa bed (Ikea) 2011? -- Free

Pretty cool corner sofa that turns into a bed, got off some Icelandic friends when they were leaving Oslo, let's continue the circle of couch giving!

You can put the corner on either side. Comes with sheet / duvet / pillows! WOW!

It's pretty faded and a bit coffee stained, but is still comfy, cleanish, and convenient for hosting guests.

Comes apart into small bits, so can fit in a car. Probably. Maybe two trips?
