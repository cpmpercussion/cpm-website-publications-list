Charles Martin is a specialist in percussion, music technology, and musical AI from Australia. He links percussion with electroacoustic music and other media through new technologies. He is the author of musical iPad app, PhaseRings, and founded touchscreen ensemble, Ensemble Metatone, percussion group, Ensemble Evolution, and cross-artform group, Last Man to Die. Charles' doctoral research involved developing intelligent agents that mediate ensemble performance.

Charles was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oslo in the [Engineering Prediction and Embodied Cognition (EPEC) project](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/epec/) and the [RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time, and Motion](https://www.hf.uio.no/ritmo/english/) from 2016--2019 where he developed new ways to predict musical intentions and performances in smartphone apps and embedded devices.

Charles is now lecturer in computer science at the Australian National University.

### Research Interests:
