Charles Martin is a specialist in percussion, music technology, and musical AI from Australia. He links percussion with electroacoustic music and other media through new technologies. He is the author of musical iPad app, PhaseRings, and founded touchscreen ensemble, Ensemble Metatone, percussion group, Ensemble Evolution, and cross-artform group, Last Man to Die. Charles' did his doctoral research at the Australian National University developing intelligent agents that mediate ensemble performance. At present, Charles is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oslo in the [Engineering Prediction and Embodied Cognition (EPEC) project](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/epec/) and the [RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time, and Motion](https://www.hf.uio.no/ritmo/english/) where he is developing new ways to predict musical intentions and performances in smartphone apps and embedded devices.

### Research Interests:

- new interfaces for musical performance
- computational creativity
- smartphone/tablet musical instruments
- collaborative performance
- co-creative interfaces
- improvisation
- percussive approaches to computer music

### Supervision:

Charles supervises masters projects in the EPEC project and ROBIN group at IFI. Projects are available in:

- developing predictive musical instruments
- machine learning of musical style
- musical AI
- computer support for collaborative musical expression

More information on interactive music and musical AI is available at the EPEC project page. Here's some helpful slides about doing musical masters projects.
