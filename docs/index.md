Charles Martin is a specialist in percussion, computer music, and interactive media from Canberra, Australia. He links percussion with electroacoustic music and other media through new technologies. In 2016, Charles joined the [Engineering Prediction and Embodied Cognition (EPEC) project](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/projects/epec/) at the University of Oslo, where he is developing new ways to predict musical intentions and performances in smartphone apps. 

From 2018, Charles is also a researcher in the [RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time, and Motion](https://www.hf.uio.no/ritmo/english/).
